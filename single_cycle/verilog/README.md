mips - A MIPS cpu in Verilog

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The goal of this project is to construct a MIPS cpu
in Verilog.

The code is assembled using a MIPS machine.
In this case the Qemu emulator is Debian Linux (debian-mips).

The Verilog code is simulated using Verilator.

And finally the CPU is implemented on a FPGA.
